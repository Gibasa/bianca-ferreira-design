At 3P Energia, the company's identity is guided by three fundamental pillars: Purpose, Performance, and Preservation. These values are not just concepts but the core of the company's mission. 3P Energia strives to lead the transition to a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable energy matrix by offering solutions that truly make a difference.

The brand redesign reflects this essence. Green, symbolizing the commitment to sustainability, has been retained, while orange was introduced as a complementary color, inspired by the sun â€” the energy that powers photovoltaic panels. The custom typography, with cuts inspired by lightning bolts, represents energy and gives the brand a more "tech" vibe.

With nearly 10 years of experience, 3P Energia has completed over 1,600 installations and executed more than 60 MWp in solar energy projects. Its technical excellence and commitment to superior performance make it a benchmark in the B2B solar energy market.

With advanced solutions aligned with the highest quality standards, 3P Energia is ready to transform the sector and contribute to a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable future.
