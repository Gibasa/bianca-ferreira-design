Pimenta is an accessories brand designed for a more mature female audience, offering sophisticated pieces that celebrate the unique beauty of every customer. With a mission to provide elegance and boost self-esteem, the brand is dedicated to creating products that make every woman feel special and confident.

The brand redesign was developed to convey sophistication and growth while preserving its essence and elevating its visual identity. The color palette was carefully reimagined, transitioning from traditional black and gold to a more feminine and refined combination of soft pink, beige, and black. This blend achieves the perfect balance between delicacy and sophistication, reflecting the brand’s target audience.

The chosen typography for the redesign is modern and sans-serif, featuring clean lines and minimal contrast to convey a contemporary and elegant look that resonates with the brand's refined style. Pimenta’s symbol draws inspiration from the shadow and reflection of a cut gemstone, with rounded edges that create a design embracing and empowering women’s self-esteem, offering a sense of warmth and exclusivity.

Pimenta is an invitation for every woman to enhance her beauty, confidence, and style with pieces that are as sophisticated as she is.
