# SEO Audit Skill

When auditing a web project for SEO, follow these steps:

## Audit checklist

1. **Technical SEO**: Analyze site structure, performance, and crawlability
   - Page load speed and Core Web Vitals
   - Mobile responsiveness and viewport configuration
   - Robots.txt and sitemap.xml presence
   - SSL/HTTPS implementation
   - URL structure and canonicalization
   - Structured data (Schema.org markup)

2. **On-Page SEO**: Review content and HTML optimization
   - Title tags (unique, descriptive, 50-60 characters)
   - Meta descriptions (compelling, 150-160 characters)
   - Header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
   - Image optimization (alt text, file size, lazy loading)
   - Internal linking structure
   - Content quality and keyword usage

3. **Semantic HTML**: Check proper use of HTML5 elements
   - Semantic tags (header, nav, main, article, section, footer)
   - ARIA labels for accessibility
   - Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags

4. **Performance**: Evaluate factors affecting user experience
   - Minification of CSS/JS
   - Image compression and modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Caching strategies
   - CDN usage

5. **Indexability**: Ensure search engines can discover content
   - No-index/no-follow tags usage
   - XML sitemap quality
   - Duplicate content issues
   - Redirect chains

## How to provide feedback

- **Prioritize issues**: Mark critical, important, and minor improvements
